title: Bringing the Museum to Grade Schoolers
subtitle: "The NMP, as part of its mandate, is a learning center. As such,
  targeting the basic education  stronghold is a way of building a museum-
  minded community with culture-related  careers, being exposed early to
  heritage appreciation and pride in their cultural identity. This initiative
  will serve as an opportunity to re-introduce the mission, vision, and mandates
  of the NMP to the public elementary schools in the rural areas especially
  those that never had the chance to visit the museum. Furthermore, this
  activity, which is geared at augmenting the grade schoolers’ lessons on
  indigenous knowledge, skills and practices (IKSP), serves as a springboard for
  the crafting of IKSP modules by the local teachers as it is corollary to the
  museum educational program of the National Museum Cordillera exhibition
  featuring “Binodbodan and Pinilian: Shared Textile Traditions Among the
  Cordillera  People” and the Basic Weaving Lecture- workshop for Grade
  Schoolers during the  National Heritage Month."
