title: The Arbitrariness of Philippine Place Names
subtitle: In celebration of Museums and Galleries Month, the Museo nina Leon at
  Galicano Apacible and Museo nina Marcela Mariño at Felipe Agoncillo would like
  to propose a lecture on the arbitrariness of Philippine place names. Just like
  Taal, it has different meaning in the Filipino language that the local
  government and its people have dilemma on tracing the etymology of their
  town’s name.
