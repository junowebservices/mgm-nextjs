title: "Dayan: Batch 2 Lecture and Workshop on Agusan Manobo Beadwork Tradition"
subtitle: "In celebration of the Museums and Galleries Month 2023, the National
  Museum of the Philippines-Butuan will hold the second batch of lecture and
  workshop on \"Dayan\" or Agusan Manobo Beadwork Tradition. This thriving
  tradition is still being practiced by some women Manobos in Agusan del Sur and
  Agusan del Norte. The NMP-Butuan considers promoting this craft and tradition
  for its preservation for the next generation. The activity shall also serve as
  a corollary activity of the “Panapton sa Lumad: Mga Arte ug  Kailhanan”
  exhibition in the Gallery II of NMP- Butuan. The lecture and workshop shall
  aid in  creating awareness and appreciation, especially among the youth, of
  the Agusan Manobo group's tangible and intangible heritage. This shall also be
  an opportunity to recognize and support the role of women in transmitting
  their tradition and drawing museum-goers' interest in protecting our culture
  and heritage."
