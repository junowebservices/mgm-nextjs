Following its successful debut last year, “Within the Walls” will be hosting its second installation for Museums and Galleries Month 2023. Produced by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, this video series connects with various museum and gallery practitioners, following some of their daily work routines, in order to know their importance in the everyday operations of museums and galleries and be appreciated by everyone, especially those who are interested in learning the ropes of being a practitioner themselves.
