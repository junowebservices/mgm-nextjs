subtitle: In celebration of the Museums and Galleries Month (MGM) and Indigenous
  Peoples Month this year, the ED, in continuing partnership with the Sentrong
  Pagpapalakas ng Negritong Kultura at Kalikasan (SPNKK), a lecture-workshop on
  collecting and documenting material culture and medicinal plants with
  cultural/economic importance among the Negrito community for the students of
  the MFS program and a presentation of the MFS outputs for the general public.
  The activity intends to highlight the importance of museums as vehicle for
  learning and IP education, as well as the best practices on collecting and
  documenting cultural materials for preservation and public display.
  Furthermore, these corollary activities with the NMP enables participation of
  both young girls and boys as future leaders of their communities, thereby
  enhancing the opportunities especially for girls to not be confined to their
  traditional roles in the community. This affirms the commitment of the NMP to
  be a gender-responsive institution pursuant to Section 36 of Republic Act No.
  9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women (MCW).

  sustainable development goals;
