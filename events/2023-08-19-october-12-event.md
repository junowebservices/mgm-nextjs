title: "Tao sa Tao: Mga Totoong Kwento ng Martial Law"
subtitle: "Tao sa Tao: Mga Totoong Kwento ng Martial Law is a storytelling
  series with Martial Law survivors that invites everyone to come as they
  are—differences in age, gender, and political views are acknowledged and
  welcomed. There are no right or wrong reactions and no right or wrong
  questions. Conversations are encouraged to flow as freely and naturally as
  possible, participants need only to remember two basic rules: listen and never
  forget."
