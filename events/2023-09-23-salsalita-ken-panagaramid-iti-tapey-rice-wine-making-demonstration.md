title: "Salsalita ken Panagaramid iti Tapey: Rice Wine-Making Demonstration"
subtitle: “Tapey” or “tapuy” (sometimes spelled tapuey) is a local term for rice
  wine produced and consumed in Ilocos and Central Cordillera. It is made from
  rice and bubod (yeast). In other communities of Cordillera such as some of
  those in Ifugao, it is called bubod or fufud. Tapey is essential on every
  occasion, ritual, and festivities among the people of Cordillera and the
  southeastern area of the Ilocos region. Sharing tapey brings the people or the
  community closer together. It forms part of their social life. Hence, tapey is
  not only a drink but it forms part of the tradition and culture of the people
  who regularly consume it. In celebration of the Museums and Galleries Month,
  this activity aims to share the experience of tapey-makers who are
  traditionally women. Through this activity, participants will learn their
  personal stories relative to tapey making, tapey’s socio- cultural
  significance, and the process of making this traditional alcoholic beverage.
