title: Bukas na Lihim na Karunungan kasama si Prop. Xiao Chua (Lecture Series)
subtitle: A 3-part lecture series that will discuss the importance of faith and
  folklore to the revolution and resistance. After each lecture, public
  historian Xiao Chua will conduct a tour of the Open Secret, an art exhibit
  that attempts to resurface the spiritual motivations behind the Philippine
  revolution against Spanish rule and ensuing resistance movements in the early
  20th century. This activity is in partnership with the Ramon Aboitiz
  Foundation, Inc. and the Casa Gorordo Museum. This is in solidarity with the
  125th Anniversary of Philippine Independence and Nationhood.
