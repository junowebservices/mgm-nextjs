For the past 25 years, Tam-awan Village has become a center for indigenous artists to create, exhibit, and sell their works. The village has also offered art workshops and hosted cultural presentations helping to pass on traditions to younger generations. The village has also begun to promote various art styles of artists from different regions in the country.
