title: "Jose PW Tantoco: Ama ng Dambana ng Casa Real"
subtitle: On October 4, 1965, President Diosdado Macapagal, through Executive
  Order No. 173, declared Casa Real as a National Shrine. This, after a tedious
  court battle between the then Municipal Council of Malolos, who passed a
  resolution to lease the Casa Real to a private individual for 25 years and
  JOSE PW TANTOCO who almost singlehandedly encouraged heritage-loving
  individuals and groups in Malolos to protest the Council’s plans and
  eventually bringing them to court. With the assistance of Mr. Carlos Quirino,
  Chairman of the Philippine Historical Committee, they were able to secure the
  President’s support that led to the historic executive order.
