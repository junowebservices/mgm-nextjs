The Museums and Galleries Month (MGM) is celebrated every month of October by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 798, s. 1991, which underscores the importance of arousing national consciousness and pride in our rich Filipino culture and heritage embodying the aspirations of the nation, expressed in all artistic media, as well as historical and religious artifacts. 

This 2023, MGM will be celebrated under the theme, **“Exhibits and Reflections: Crafting Opportunities for the New World”** that encompasses the role of museums and galleries in showcasing art forms as an avenue to interpret various facets of humanity — from intrapersonal to global — that have always been discussed for years. They also have been the host to various microcosms that serve as catalysts for human beings from all walks of life, providing chances to reflect, restart, and redirect themselves to a better future.

T﻿he Kick-Off Ceremony will be held at the National Museum of Fine Arts this 01 October 2023 and is open to public.
