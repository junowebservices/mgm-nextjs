title: "TUNGO SA TALA: Wakas ang Panimula: A UPHSL Arts and Design Exhibition"
subtitle: 'In relation to this year’s MGM theme of “Exhibit and Reflections:
  Creating Opportunities for the New World”, the University of Perpetual Help
  System Laguna (UPHSL) – Arts and Design Track (A&D) in partnership with the
  Biñan City Culture, History, Arts and Tourism Office (BCHATO) introduce to the
  "Tungo sa Tala: Wakas ang Panimula," an enlightening journey through time and
  tradition. In a world constantly moving, our exhibit wishes to contemplate the
  enduring essence of humanity, "People change with time, and in the end, so
  little of what we started with remains intact." these words remind us of our
  ever-evolving nature where we, as Filipinos have our own individualities yet
  we later on realize that the present doors open for us now are the doors
  opened by our ancestors. Through this showcase, we’ll explore the thread of
  values, traditions, art, and culture woven by our forefathers that continues
  to shape our identities today as citizens in the Philippines. This project
  serves as an early firsthand experience for the Grade 11 Tomas and Grade 12
  Topaz of UPHSL Arts and Design in holding an arts exhibition outside the
  campus premises under the mentorship of the Director of UPHSL Center for
  Culture and Arts, Mr. Bryan Neil B. Ladim.  The exhibition will run from
  October 2-14, 2023. '
