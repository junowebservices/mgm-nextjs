With the theme, “Mindanao Art in Glitch: Resonating and Reverberating,” the art fair will highlight how Mindanao artists recover and move with the changing times and adapt to the so-called "new normal,” giving emphasis on their struggles, dreams, ideas, reflections, and hopes as they continue to live their lives as creative individuals in this uncertain moment.
