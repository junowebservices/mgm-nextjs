title: "The Presidential Standard: The Flag of the President of the Philippines
  (Exhibit)"
subtitle: The Presidential Standard, even when depicted on presidential
  portraits, does not get due attention. However, this symbol of authority has
  evolved through the years as much as how the country has changed presidents.
  The Presidential Standard was patterned after the U.S presidential flag and
  was first introduced during Manuel L. Quezon’s term as first President of the
  Commonwealth in 1935. At the time, the banner only had the Coat-of-Arms of the
  Commonwealth of the Philippines emblazoned on the field of U.S. Navy Blue with
  four stars on the four corners of the rectangular field. This was based on the
  U.S. Governor-General’s flag, which was in turn, inspired by the flag of the
  U.S. President from 1912. The stars on the four corners held no particular
  meaning.
