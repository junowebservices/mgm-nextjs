					<p>
						<strong>
							“Exhibits and Reflections: Creating Opportunities for the New
							World”
						</strong>{' '}
						encompasses the role of museums and galleries in showcasing art
						forms as an avenue to interpret various facets of humanity that have
						always been discussed for years. From intrapersonal to global
						issues, museums and galleries have been the host to various
						microcosms that serve as catalysts for human beings from all walks
						of life, providing chances to reflect, restart, and redirect
						themselves to a better future.
					</p>

					<p>
						The said theme aligns with the celebration of 2023 International
						Museum Day: “Museums, Sustainability, and Wellbeing” which aims to
						achieve the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goals,
						focusing on regulating climate, fostering inclusivity, and tackling
						socio-personal issues. It also integrates the narrative of the theme
						of 125th Celebration of Philippine Independence: “Kalayaan,
						Kinabukasan, Kasaysayan” which aims to highlight the opportunities
						made by our ancestors to attain the freedom we achieve right now,
						and how shall the present preserve and pass it on for more
						generations to come.
