title: The Impacts and Concerns related to animation in Depicting Historical Events
subtitle: History is a big discussion these days as concerns on revisions and
  accuracy of its depiction arises with regards to its presentation particularly
  in medias. Animation, on the other hand is not spared when it comes to
  concerns of depictions and retelling of such. How do we discern now history as
  accurate if this is retold by a medium that is intended for entertainment?
  What is the impact of Animation in retelling and promoting history or real
  events to society through its audience?
